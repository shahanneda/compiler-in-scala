Tutorials are optional:
	- Cover hints for assignments 



# Bits
- All about conventions, bits themselves have no meaning, just what we assign to them
- Represent -x as 2^n - x
- Range of twos complement is 
- 2^(n-1) to 2^(n-1) - 1 (top of range is becuase 1111 is 2^4 - 1, so basically with remaining digits we can get all the way except that last power)



## Division method of finding binary representation
- Keep dividing by two, while keeping track of the remainder.
